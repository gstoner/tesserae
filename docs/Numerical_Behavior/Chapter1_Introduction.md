# Tessera Numerical Behavior Guide
## Chapter 1: Introduction & Motivation

---

### 1.1 Why Numerical Behavior Matters

Modern deep learning and scientific computing rely on **floating-point arithmetic**, which is inherently limited by:
- **Finite precision** (round-off errors).  
- **Non-associativity** of operations (order matters).  
- **Hardware-specific implementations** (e.g., NVIDIA TensorCores vs. AMD Matrix Cores).  

Small discrepancies can lead to:
- Divergent model training runs.  
- Instability in iterative solvers (e.g., PDEs, optimization).  
- Inconsistent results across GPUs or clusters.

### 1.2 The Tessera Philosophy

Tessera treats **numerical control as a first-class concern**.  
Unlike traditional frameworks that hide floating-point quirks, Tessera explicitly exposes:
- **Determinism policies** (bitwise reproducibility).  
- **Mixed precision modes** (FP32, BF16, FP16, FP8).  
- **Stability-enhancing operators** (compensated summation, safe softmax).  

This allows developers to **balance performance and accuracy** per application domain:
- **ML training**: maximize throughput with BF16/FP16 while keeping FP32 accumulation.  
- **Physics-informed ML**: enforce stable adjoints for PDE operators.  
- **Research reproducibility**: ensure deterministic results across runs.

### 1.3 Numerical Tradeoffs in Deep Learning

| Choice             | Pros                               | Cons                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| FP32 everywhere    | High accuracy, easy debugging      | High memory & compute cost        |
| BF16/FP16 compute  | Faster, lower memory footprint     | Risk of underflow/overflow        |
| FP8 compute        | Enables trillion-param models      | Requires careful scaling, tuning  |
| Deterministic mode | Exact reproducibility              | Lower performance (ordered ops)   |
| Fast mode          | Max speed, async atomics           | Non-deterministic results         |

### 1.4 Scope of this Guide

This guide documents:
- How Tessera ensures **deterministic execution**.  
- Policies for **mixed precision arithmetic**.  
- Strategies for **numerical stability** in reductions and operators.  
- Methods to ensure **cross-hardware consistency**.  

Each subsequent chapter dives deeper:
1. **Deterministic Execution** → reproducibility in training.  
2. **Mixed Precision Arithmetic** → FP16, BF16, FP8 workflows.  
3. **Stability in Reductions** → summation, optimization.  
4. **Stability in Operators** → attention, normalization, PDEs.  
5. **Cross-Hardware Consistency** → NVIDIA vs. AMD results.  
6. **Best Practices** → recipes for practitioners.  
7. **Appendix** → reference tables & defaults.

### 1.5 Key Takeaway

**Numerical behavior is not a side-effect—it is part of the programming model.**  
Tessera makes these controls explicit so developers can choose between:  
- **Reproducibility** (science, debugging).  
- **Performance** (large-scale training).  
- **Stability** (physics, symbolic operators).
