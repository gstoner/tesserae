# Tessera QA & Reliability Guide  
## Chapter 6: Reliability in Production

---

## 6.1 Introduction  

While QA ensures correctness during development, **production environments** require additional reliability strategies.  
This chapter covers best practices for running Tessera workloads in real-world multi-tenant GPU clusters.  

Key goals:  
- Monitor execution for anomalies.  
- Detect regressions in performance or accuracy.  
- Enable reproducibility through replay.  
- Integrate with observability tools.  

---

## 6.2 Monitoring and Health Checks  

Tessera provides APIs to monitor execution status, memory usage, and performance counters.  

**Example: Monitoring Hooks**
```python
from tessera import monitor, graph

@graph.training_step
def step(batch):
    out = model(batch["x"])
    loss = op.cross_entropy(out, batch["y"])
    monitor.log(metric="loss", value=loss.item())
    return loss
```

**Best Practices:**  
- Track GPU memory utilization.  
- Log kernel launch latencies.  
- Capture all-reduce times in distributed jobs.  

---

## 6.3 Automated Regression Detection  

Regression tests run periodically to catch unexpected slowdowns or accuracy drops.  

**Example: Performance Regression Check**
```python
from tessera import benchmark

time_ms = benchmark(op.matmul, A, B)
if time_ms > 1.2 * baseline_time_ms:
    raise RuntimeError("Performance regression detected")
```

---

## 6.4 Replay Debugging  

Reproducibility in production is crucial. Tessera supports **deterministic replay** by recording random seeds, operator graphs, and kernel schedules.  

**Example: Replay Capture**
```python
from tessera import replay

# Record a training run
replay.capture("session1")

# Later: reproduce identical run
replay.load("session1")
```

---

## 6.5 Observability and Profiling  

Tessera integrates with profilers and observability stacks.  
- Export traces in **Chrome Trace Event format**.  
- Support for Prometheus/Grafana metrics.  
- TensorBoard plugins for training runs.  

**Example: Profiling Session**
```python
from tessera import profile

with profile.trace("training_trace.json"):
    step(batch)
```

---

## 6.6 Fault Tolerance in Production  

At scale, faults are inevitable. Tessera provides:  
- **Automatic checkpointing** for crash recovery.  
- **Watchdogs** for stuck kernels.  
- **Fallback scheduling** when a device fails.  

**Example: Automatic Fallback**
```python
from tessera import fallback

try:
    Y = op.matmul(A, B)
except DeviceError:
    with fallback.to("cpu"):
        Y = op.matmul(A, B)
```

---

## 6.7 Best Practices for Production Reliability  

- Use **monitoring hooks** for health and metrics.  
- Automate **performance regression detection**.  
- Always enable **replay capture** for debugging.  
- Integrate **profiling and observability** into pipelines.  
- Ensure **fault tolerance** with checkpoints and fallbacks.
