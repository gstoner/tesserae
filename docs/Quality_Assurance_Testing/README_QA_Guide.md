# Tessera QA & Reliability Guide

This guide provides practical strategies, methodologies, and best practices for ensuring **quality assurance (QA)** and **reliability** of Tessera programs across single devices, multi-GPU systems, and large-scale clusters.

## ðŸ“– Contents

### **Chapter 1: Introduction to QA & Reliability**
- Overview of why QA matters in AI/HPC programming.  
- Levels of QA: unit tests, integration tests, system tests.  
- Role of reliability at scale (device â†’ rack â†’ cluster).  

### **Chapter 2: Single Device QA**
- Unit tests for operators and kernels.  
- Correctness validation against golden models.  
- Memory safety, determinism, and reproducibility.  

### **Chapter 3: Multi-GPU & Node QA**
- Testing distributed collectives (all-reduce, broadcast).  
- Ensuring determinism across parallelism strategies.  
- Validation of sharding and tensor layouts.  

### **Chapter 4: Rack & Cluster-Scale QA**
- End-to-end QA for 64â€“128+ GPU clusters.  
- Stress testing communication fabric.  
- Ensuring operator graphs scale without divergence.  

### **Chapter 5: QA Methodologies**
- Golden model testing.  
- Differential testing (vs PyTorch/JAX).  
- Property-based randomized testing.  
- CI/CD integration and performance regression detection.  

### **Chapter 6: Reliability in Production**
- Monitoring and health checks.  
- Automated regression detection.  
- Replay debugging for reproducibility.  
- Observability and profiling integration.  
- Fault tolerance with checkpoints and fallbacks.  

### **Chapter 7: Stress & Chaos Testing**
- Stress tests for long-running and high-load jobs.  
- Chaos testing (device/node failures, network faults).  
- Distributed chaos validation.  
- Best practices for resilience validation.

## âœ… How to Use This Guide
- Developers: Apply **unit and integration QA** when building new operators.  
- Researchers: Use **differential testing and golden baselines** when comparing with other frameworks.  
- Systems Engineers: Apply **stress/chaos testing** before deploying to production clusters.  
- Ops Teams: Leverage **monitoring, replay, and fault tolerance** for production reliability.
