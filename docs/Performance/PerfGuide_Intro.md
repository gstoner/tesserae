# Tessera Performance Best Practices Guide
## Chapter 1: Introduction

---

### 1.1 Purpose

The **Tessera Performance Best Practices Guide** is designed to help developers maximize performance across GPU and distributed systems.  
It complements the **Tessera Programming Guide** and **Runtime & ABI Spec**, providing *practical advice* on:

- Kernel occupancy and parallel execution
- Memory hierarchy utilization
- Autotuning workflows
- Operator fusion and pipelines
- Mixed precision numerics
- Distributed training
- Profiling and debugging

---

### 1.2 Scope

This guide focuses on:

- **Kernel-level performance**: Tile/block/warp optimizations within a single GPU.
- **Distributed execution**: Multi-GPU and NVLink/NVSwitch performance.
- **System-scale tuning**: Autotuning, persistence of schedules, and cost models.

It does **not** cover:

- Algorithmic model design (see *High-Level Modeling Language* docs)
- Runtime ABI details (see *Runtime & ABI Spec*)

---

### 1.3 Audience

This guide is for:

- **Kernel developers** writing custom Tessera operators
- **System researchers** exploring new parallel algorithms
- **ML engineers** training large models who need performance tuning
- **Performance analysts** profiling workloads at scale

### 1.4 Performance Stack in Tessera

Performance in Tessera is layered:

1. **Graph IR**  
   – Algebraic rewrites, autodiff transformations, operator fusion opportunities.

2. **Schedule IR**  
   – Fusion, tiling, pipeline optimization, autotuning cost models.

3. **Tile IR**  
   – Warp/block-level mapping, TensorCore usage, memory coalescing.

4. **Target IR**  
   – Lowering to LLVM/MLIR backends (PTX, AMDGPU, SPIR-V).

### 1.5 Key Takeaways

- Tessera performance is a *multi-level optimization problem*.  
- Operator fusion and autotuning are as important as raw occupancy.  
- Distributed performance requires explicit mesh-aware sharding.  
- Deterministic reductions and reproducible tuning are first-class goals.
