## When we give CHATGPT a Cupcake, it gives you a New Programing Model and then...... 

This Programing Model emerged after  spend time talking with ChatGPT 5 about  current progrmaing models SyCL, CUDA, Mojo, NUMBA, Chapel,  and you asked "if you could start over what would be the ideal programming model/language for programming deep learning model and solutions"  

I will say you it is very interactive coversation to get to limited early draft spec, but that will need to be another post to go deeper. 


What i can saw is this model has come along way in the abilty to look at situation and reason about what might be needed in the market, with a bit more work will give you the bones for solid spec.   The area i was not satified with is how it tired to turn this into a techical presentations and convert the spec into a pdf as well build a datasheet, here we humans are still master of this domain. 

Let look at the what it came up with.  

Tessera as a programming model is that it tries to bridge the gap between mathematical expressiveness and hardware efficiency, something existing models (CUDA, Triton, SYCL, etc.) only partially solve.
 
 # Motivation *(Informative)*

## 1. Why Not Just CUDA, Triton, or SYCL?
- **CUDA**: Extremely powerful, but low-level, imperative, and hardware-specific. Developers spend huge effort managing tiling, memory hierarchies, and determinism. Not portable across vendors.  
- **Triton**: Great for tile-level DSLs and custom kernels, but still requires users to think about warp/block sizes. Does not expose a unifying algebra of operators.  
- **SYCL**: Tried to be portable, but failed due to boilerplate-heavy abstractions, vendor fragmentation, and poor ergonomics.  

All of these are **execution-focused**, but lack a coherent *algebra of operators* and *spectral/symbolic reasoning*.

---

## 2. Tessera’s Core Idea
- **Operators as first-class citizens**: Instead of kernels or functions, Tessera programs manipulate operators algebraically (compose, adjoint, spectral factorization).  
- **Tiles as the hardware bridge**: The runtime lowers operator algebra to tile plans automatically (autotuned like Triton).  
- **Graphs for execution flow**: Scheduling, streams, dependencies are graph-based, ensuring determinism and optimizability.  
- **Spectral + Symbolic reasoning**: Tessera’s Operator Dialect (TOD) encodes algebraic rewrites and Hilbert space semantics, enabling new forms of compression, symbolic learning, and reasoning that go beyond current ML DSLs.

---

## 3. Why It Matters
- **Portability**: Tessera abstracts CUDA/ROCm/other backends without repeating SYCL’s mistakes — because the abstraction is algebraic, not imperative.  
- **Productivity**: Researchers can work at the operator/graph level, while the compiler/runtime handles tiling, scheduling, and memory layout.  
- **Future-proofing**: By baking in spectral decomposition, recursion operators, and graph rewrites, Tessera is aligned with the next generation of ML (beyond transformer-only).  
- **ABI Stability**: With a carefully specified runtime ABI, models compiled once can run across future hardware without recompilation.  

---

## 4. In Short
Tessera exists because we need a **math-native, operator-first programming model** that unifies:  
- CUDA’s raw performance  
- Triton’s tile-level efficiency  
- Algebraic/spectral reasoning from operator theory  
- ABI/runtime stability

## Part I: Introduction and Scope *(Informative)*

Tessera is a programming model and runtime designed for deep learning and operator-based AI workloads. It generalizes existing models (CUDA, Triton, SYCL) by:

- **Tiles** as first-class units of computation.
- **Graphs** for higher-level control and optimization.
- **Operators** as algebraic primitives, enabling symbolic reasoning and spectral methods.

---

## Part II: Execution Model *(Normative)*

- **Tiles**: minimal scheduling units, mapped to warp/wave equivalents.
- **Graphs**: DAGs of operators/kernels with explicit dependencies.
- **Streams**: independent execution contexts; ordering only guaranteed within a stream.
- **Synchronization**: via explicit barriers and events.

---

## Part III: Numerics and Precision Policy *(Normative)*

- Types: FP32, FP16, BF16, FP8, INT8, etc.
- Each type has an **accumulation policy** (e.g., FP8\@accum(FP32)).
- Determinism mode: reproducibility across reductions, sort order, and spectral decompositions.

---

## Part IV: Memory and Streams *(Normative)*

- **Address spaces**: global, shared (tile-local), private.
- **Streams**: allow concurrency.
- **Events**: synchronization primitives across streams.
- **Memory consistency**: relaxed by default, sequential within a stream.

---

## Part V: Tiling and Scheduling *(Normative)*

- **Tile primitives**: GEMM, FFT, CONV, REDUCE.
- **Schedules**: parameters (BM, BN, BK, warps, stages, vector width, swizzle).
- **Autotuning**: schedule search per `(arch, shape, dtype-policy)`.
- **Determinism**: schedules MUST obey global determinism flags.

```c
typedef struct {
  uint32_t arch;
  uint32_t num_tiles;
  TessTileDesc tiles[MAX_TILES];
} TessKernelDesc;
```

 - Factorization gradients follow standard SVD/eig differentials.



## Part VIII: Graph, Modules, and Compilation *(Normative)*

- **Graphs**: DAGs of operators and kernels.
